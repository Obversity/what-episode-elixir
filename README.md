# Episode Finder

This project is an in-progress API re-write of [this 'episode-finder' rails backend](https://github.com/Obversity/what-episode-rails), built with the intention of learning the basics of Elixir and Phoenix.

## Running the app

To start start this API app:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Check the router.ex to see what json endpoints exist.
